## What is schemas.science?

**[schemas.science](https://schemas.science)** is a community effort which aims at improving the Findability on the Web
of scientific research data, products and resources. It does this by encouraging the use
of [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) markup in their
websites so that they are indexable by search engines and other services. schemas.science encourages the consistent use
of markup tailored for diverse scientific domains. This structured information then makes it easier to
discover, collate, analyse and consume distributed resources.

| :---------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| [FormalParameter](profiles/FormalParameter.md) | Bioschemas specification for describing a formal parameter in the Life Sciences. Version: 1.0-RELEASE (09 March 2021)   |
| [ComputationalTool](profiles/ComputationalTool.md) | The Life Science Tools specification provides a way to describe bioscience tools and software on the World Wide Web. It defines a set of metadata and vocabularies, built on top of existing technologies and standards, that can be used to represent such tools in Web pages and applications. The goal of the specification is to make it easier to discover. Version 1.0-RELEASE.<h3>Summary of Changes</h3> <p>Changes since the 0.6-DRAFT</p> <ul> <li>additionalType property deprecated and replaced by applicationCategory.</li><li>example added for the name property.</li></ul>  |
| [ComputationalWorkflow](profiles/ComputationalWorkflow.md) | A computational workflow consists of an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of activity enabled by the systematic organization of resources into processes that transform materials, provide services, or process information (source Wikipedia.org). It is executed by a computational process and is thus distinct from laboratory or business workflows. version 1.0-RELEASE  |
| [DataCatalog](profiles/DataCatalog.md) | A guide for how to describe data catalogs/repositories in the life-sciences using Schema.org-like annotation. Version 0.3-RELEASE-2019_07_01  |
| [Dataset](profiles/Dataset.md) | A guide for how to describe datasets in the life-sciences using Schema.org-like annotation. Version 1.0-RELEASE. <h3>Summary of Changes</h3> <br>Key changes since 0.3-RELEASE:<ul><li>Updated properties to Schema.org v12.0; various properties added at recommended or optional level, expected types updated.

| [Course](profiles/Course.md) | Specification describing a course.  This specification must be used in tandem with a courseInstance. A course is used to describe the broad, common aspects of a recurring training event - whereas a course instance is about the specific times and location of when that course is held. <h4>Summary of Changes</h4>    No changes since 0.10-DRAFT of the Course profile.</li>         </ul> Version: 1.0-RELEASE (13 September 2022)   |
| [CourseInstance](profiles/CourseInstance.md) | Specification describing the instance of a course.  This specification can be used in tandem with a Course. A course is used to describe the broad, common aspects of a recurring training event - whereas a course instance is about the specific times and location of when that course is held. <h4>Summary of Changes</h4>    No changes since 0.9-DRAFT of the CourseInstance profile.
